A dynamic stylish web site that populates the page with gifs of the 90s movies. By default, the user is presented with buttons for 3 movies. As the user clicks the movie button, the page is populated with 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing. Each gif contains rating information (PG, G, etc.) which is derived from the GIPHY API. The site also allows the user to input a movie of their liking. The app adds a button for the selected movie which will have the same functionality as the default buttons. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, flexbox for responsive design, JavaScript, jQuery, GIPHY API.
